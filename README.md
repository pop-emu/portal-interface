# PicoWPortal interface
This is the web interface for the PicoWPortal. This allows you to control the device using a UI instead of through it's API.

## How to build
To build, you first have to install all dependencies by running `yarn`.

### Development
For development, you just have to run `yarn dev`. A development server should now have started.

### Release
For release, run `yarn build`. If you then want to preview the build, run `yarn preview`. A preview server will now have started.

## How to get the device IP
To get the IP address of the device, check out [the PicoWPortal repository](https://github.com/pop-emu/PicoWPortal/tree/master#how-to-acquire-the-ip-address-of-the-device).
